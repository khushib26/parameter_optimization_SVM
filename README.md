# discussion:
From the above graph, we can conclude that the model is well trained and parameter have been optimized due to the less gap between training and cross-validation curve.

The graph is made for the sample which has best accuracy. Sample 4 and 10 has the best accuracy of 0.84 having kernel = Poly and linear, Nu = 1.32 and Nu=9.99 and Epsilon = 6.00 and Epsilon=6.31 respectively.
